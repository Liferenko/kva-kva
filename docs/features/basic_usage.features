Feature: generate a keyword list
  As a PPC specialist, startup founder, digital marketing person, SEO specialist
  I want to get a list of keywords combinations from my few references

  Scenario: customer gives a short list of keywords and receive a huge list of keywords' possible variations
    Given: the customer enters a bundle of keywords in few separated text inputs
	When the customer clicked "Generate" button at the end of a webform
	Then Web app shows an easy-to-copy list of keywords
		And a button "Download csv-file"
